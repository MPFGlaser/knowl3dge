# Frontend research document

## Introduction

In this file I will document my findings and sources during the time I research what frontend framework is most suitable for the KNOWL3DGE project. The research will be done according to the DOT research framework and sources will be cited as is required. 

## Main question: What framework is suitable for use in the KNOWL3DGE project?

What framework is suitable for the project depends on many factors. To find the best fit, we will be investigating several sub-questions and draw a conclusion based on them. Because of the curriculum, we will only be investigating React and Angular 2.

### What does the project require, UI-wise?


### What are the technical differences between the two frameworks?
